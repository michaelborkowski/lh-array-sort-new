# lh-array-sort
Various "in place" sorting algorithms verified with LH

Now have: Proof of Sortedness for Merge, Linear Merge and Insertion, Proof of Equivalence for all using Bag

Array are implemented using { List, left: Int, right: Int } with slice api

Checking time should not exceed 2min for any single file. Slightly faster than List implementation of Array (main branch)
